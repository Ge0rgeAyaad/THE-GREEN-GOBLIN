# 🌿 THE GREEN GOBLIN

**THE GREEN GOBLIN** is a bio-based air purification system that uses four bottles containing **Chlorella algae** to naturally filter and refresh the air. Inspired by Earth’s own atmospheric cleansing system, this closed-loop project showcases how biology and engineering can work together to fight air pollution—one breath at a time.

## 🧪 Project Description

The system circulates air through four transparent bottles filled with nutrient-rich water and *Chlorella*, a photosynthetic microalga known for its ability to absorb **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** and release **oxygen (O₂)**. When light is introduced, the algae begin photosynthesis, effectively cleaning the air inside the system.

This project is ideal for environmental education, small-space air purification experiments, or showcasing green technology at science fairs.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Air Circulation**: A small fan or pump moves ambient air through the bottles in a closed loop.
2. **Algae Interaction**: As the air passes through each bottle, CO₂ is absorbed by the Chlorella, and O₂ is released.
3. **Photosynthesis**: Under LED or natural light, the algae convert carbon dioxide into oxygen.
4. **Continuous Loop**: The filtered air recirculates through the system for ongoing purification.
