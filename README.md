# üåø THE GREEN GOBLIN

**THE GREEN GOBLIN** is a closed-loop, bio-based air purification system that uses **Chlorella algae** to naturally filter and clean the air. Housed in four transparent bottles, the algae absorb carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) and release fresh oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) through photosynthesis. The system also includes a **CO‚ÇÇ sensor** to monitor air quality in real time, making it both functional and educational.

## üß¨ Project Description

This project mimics the Earth‚Äôs natural carbon-capturing processes using Chlorella algae in a compact, self-contained system. As air is circulated through four algae-filled bottles, CO‚ÇÇ is absorbed and O‚ÇÇ is released. A CO‚ÇÇ sensor continuously measures the carbon dioxide level inside the system, giving users live data on air quality and system performance.

**THE GREEN GOBLIN** is ideal for:
- Environmental science education  
- DIY sustainable tech demonstrations  
- Indoor air quality awareness  
- Eco-friendly hobbyist projects

## üîÅ How It Works

1. **Air Circulation**: A low-power pump or fan circulates air through a closed system of four bottles.
2. **Algae Interaction**: Each bottle contains *Chlorella*, a fast-growing green microalga known for CO‚ÇÇ absorption.
3. **Photosynthesis**: Under LED or natural light, the algae convert CO‚ÇÇ into O‚ÇÇ.
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: A built-in CO‚ÇÇ sensor continuously tracks air quality and provides feedback.
5. **Closed Ecosystem**: The air recirculates through the algae chambers for continuous filtration.
