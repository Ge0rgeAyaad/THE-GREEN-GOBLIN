# THE-GREEN-GOBLIN
THE GREEN GOBLIN is a sustainable, closed-loop air purification project that uses Chlorella algae housed in four transparent bottles to naturally filter and refresh air. This innovative system mimics the planet’s natural carbon-capturing mechanisms by leveraging the photosynthetic power of algae to reduce CO₂ levels and release clean oxygen.
